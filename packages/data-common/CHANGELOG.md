# @aws-blocks/data-common

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- c4313cd: Fix `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a fresh `create-blocks-app` scaffold by making required runtime packages real dependencies of the block that actually loads them. npm does not install peer dependencies of transitive dependencies, so these never landed in `node_modules`.

  - `kysely` → dependency of `@aws-blocks/data-common`. `data-common` is the only package that imports and instantiates `kysely` (in its Kysely adapter); `bb-data` and `bb-distributed-data` merely re-export `createKyselyAdapter` and keep `kysely` as a peer, which is now satisfied transitively via `data-common`. Promoting it on `data-common` alone guarantees a single hoisted instance and installs it for any app that pulls a data block.
  - `@opentelemetry/api` → dependency of `@aws-blocks/bb-agent`. It is a non-optional peer of `@strands-agents/sdk`, which the Agent block loads at runtime, so it must be installed whenever `bb-agent` is present.

  Both packages have zero runtime dependencies and no install scripts, so this adds no transitive tree.
