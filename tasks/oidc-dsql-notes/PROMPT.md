# Task: OIDC Notes (DistributedDatabase)

Build a personal notes app gated by OIDC sign-in. A visitor signs in through an OIDC provider, then creates notes that belong to them and persist in a distributed SQL database across reloads.

## Setup (do this first)

The workspace has already been scaffolded. Begin by reading README.md, then do all your edits in this workspace.

Replace the scaffold's starter todo demo with your OIDC-gated notes app.

## Requirements

1. **OIDC sign-in.** A signed-out visitor sees a single sign-in button; clicking it signs the visitor in through an OIDC provider (**named exactly `stub`**), after which a cookie session is established and the profile + note editor appear. On load, the session is **restored from the cookie** and the signed-in view re-renders — surfacing the profile and keeping the visitor signed in across reloads (requirement 4).
2. **Profile.** Once signed in, show the signed-in user's stable subject id (e.g. the OIDC `userId`) in `[data-testid=profile-sub]`, and hide the sign-in button.
3. **Notes in DistributedDatabase.** A signed-in user can type a note and add it. Notes are stored in a **`DistributedDatabase`** table (create a `.sql` migration under `aws-blocks/dsql-migrations/`), scoped to the current user, and each note renders in the list.
   - Store and display note text **verbatim** — including long notes and unicode / emoji: use **parameterized** SQL (so a note containing a single quote like `' OR '1'='1` round-trips intact rather than breaking the query), and render the text as **text content**, never as HTML (`<b>x</b>` must show literally, not become a real element).
   - **Stable ordering:** list the notes **oldest-first (in the order they were created)**, backed by a stored timestamp or sequential id plus an explicit `ORDER BY` — the order must be identical on every load and after adding more notes (don't rely on unspecified database row order).
   - **No deduplication:** adding the same text twice creates **two** separate note rows.
4. **Persistence.** After a full page reload the visitor is still signed in (session cookie restored) and **all** of their notes are still listed; the note editor remains functional after the reload (adding another note still works).
5. **Input validation.** Disable `[data-testid=add-note-btn]` while the note input is empty or whitespace-only (trim before the check); re-enable it once real text is present.

## Selector contract

The Playwright test grades your work using these `data-testid` hooks. Implement them exactly. The signed-out vs signed-in views are told apart by which hooks are present: the sign-in button shows only when signed out; the profile + note hooks show only when signed in.

An inactive view's hooks must be REMOVED from the DOM (the grader asserts `toHaveCount(0)`); hiding them with CSS (`display:none` / `hidden`) will fail.

| Selector | Element | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `[data-testid=signin-btn]` | `<button>` | Starts the OIDC sign-in flow; shown when signed out |
| `[data-testid=profile-sub]` | element in the signed-in view | Renders the signed-in user's subject id (non-empty) |
| `[data-testid=note-input]` | `<input>` / `<textarea>` | Where the user types a note |
| `[data-testid=add-note-btn]` | `<button>` | Adds the note for the current user; disabled while the input is empty/whitespace |
| `[data-testid=note-item]` | one per note | A note row; must render the note's text verbatim as text content (no HTML injection) |

A `[data-testid=note-item]` must contain the note's text (the test locates a note via `filter({ hasText: text })`).

The mount point is the existing root element. Replace the template's todo UI.

## Out of scope

- Real OIDC providers / credentials (use the stub provider locally), refresh-token UX, multi-provider pickers
- Editing / deleting / sharing notes, rich text
- Realtime sync between tabs (do not add a Realtime block)
- Styling beyond what makes the test pass

## Done means

- All Playwright assertions pass against the running dev server.
- No errors in the browser console under normal use.
- Your changes stay inside the workspace root. Don't modify anything under `node_modules/`.
