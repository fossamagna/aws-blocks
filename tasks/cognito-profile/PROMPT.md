# Task: Passwordless Email-OTP Profile

Build a passwordless sign-in flow in this AWS Blocks app. A visitor enters their email, receives a one-time code, enters the code, and lands on a profile page that shows who they're signed in as. They can sign out.

## Setup (do this first)

The workspace has already been scaffolded. Begin by reading README.md, then do all your edits in this workspace.

## Requirements

1. A signed-out visitor sees an **email field** and a **submit button**. Submitting begins a passwordless sign-up / sign-in for that email and sends a one-time verification code. If that email **already has an account** (e.g., a returning visitor who previously signed out), detect it and run the **sign-in** code path instead of failing with a "user already exists" error — the same email must be able to authenticate again and land on its profile. An **empty or whitespace-only** email is invalid: validate/trim before submitting and do **not** begin auth or advance to the code view for it — stay on the email form (no code is sent, no unhandled error).
2. The view then shows a **code field** and its own **submit button**. Submitting the code completes authentication and establishes a session.
3. Once authenticated, the visitor sees a **profile** view that renders the signed-in user's identity (their email / username) — and the email/code fields are gone.
4. The profile view has a **sign-out** button that returns the visitor to the signed-out email form.
5. **Reject bad codes.** If the submitted code is wrong **or blank/empty**, catch the error and stay on the code-entry view — do **not** establish a session or throw an unhandled error. When a code is actually rejected, show a message in `[data-testid=auth-error]`; that hook must be **absent until a code is rejected** (don't render an empty error element on the fresh code-entry view). A wrong code does **not** end the attempt: the verification session stays valid (retriable), so the visitor can immediately re-enter the **correct** code on the same view and sign in — and once they do, the error must be **cleared** (`auth-error` is removed again).
6. **Session persistence.** The session lives in a cookie: on a full page reload the visitor stays signed in and the profile re-renders their identity (restore it on load). The signed-out and code-entry hooks must be absent while signed in.
7. **Clean sign-out.** Signing out fully clears the session so a *different* email can sign in afterward and the profile shows the new identity (no stale cached user). A full page reload **after** signing out must **not** restore the session — it stays on the signed-out email form.

This is email-OTP / passwordless: the visitor never types a password. One identifier (the email) on the way in, then the emailed code.

## Test harness contract (required)

The grader has no mailbox, so it reads the OTP over JSON-RPC. **Expose an `api` namespace method `getLastCode()`** that returns the most recently delivered code as `{ username, code }` (or `null`). The grader retrieves it by POSTing to `/aws-blocks/api`:

```
POST /aws-blocks/api
Content-Type: application/json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "api.getLastCode", "params": [], "id": 1 }
```

## Selector contract

The Playwright test grades your work using these `data-testid` hooks. Implement them exactly. The signed-out, code-entry, and signed-in views are told apart by which hooks are present.

An inactive view's hooks must be REMOVED from the DOM (the grader asserts `toHaveCount(0)`); hiding them with CSS (`display:none` / `hidden`) will fail.

| Selector | Element | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `[data-testid=auth-email]` | `<input type="email">` | The email to sign up / sign in with; shown when signed out |
| `[data-testid=auth-submit]` | `<button>` | Begin auth and send the one-time code |
| `[data-testid=otp-input]` | `<input>` | Where the visitor types the emailed code |
| `[data-testid=otp-submit]` | `<button>` | Submit the code to complete authentication |
| `[data-testid=profile-username]` | element in the signed-in view | Renders the signed-in user's email / username |
| `[data-testid=signout-btn]` | `<button>` | Sign out; shown only when signed in |
| `[data-testid=auth-error]` | element shown in the code-entry view | Renders an error message when the submitted code is rejected (absent until a code is rejected) |

After the code is confirmed, `[data-testid=profile-username]` must contain the signed-in user's identity (the email address that signed in).

The mount point for your page is the existing root element. You can replace whatever placeholder content the template ships with.

## Out of scope

- Passwords, password reset, MFA beyond the email OTP, social / federated login
- Groups / roles, custom attributes, device tracking (you may remove any UI not required by this task)
- Styling beyond what makes the test pass

## Done means

- All Playwright assertions pass against the running dev server.
- No errors in the browser console under normal use.
- Your changes stay inside the workspace root. Don't modify anything under `node_modules/`.
