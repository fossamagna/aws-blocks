/**
 * Judge step: grade the agent's implementation on the source code only.
 *
 * Fairness moves:
 *   - Different model from the builder by default (Opus 4.8 vs builder's
 *     Sonnet 4.6) to limit same-model self-evaluation bias.
 *   - Judge determinism rests on the structured-output schema + deterministic
 *     hard caps (the judge model rejects `temperature`); the builder pins
 *     temperature=0.
 *   - Evidence (build/test/scaffold pass-fail) is NOT shown to the judge —
 *     it would anchor the qualitative dimensions. The orchestrator applies
 *     those signals as deterministic hard caps after the model returns.
 *
 * Inputs (env):
 *   WORKSPACE         absolute path to the implemented bench-app (read-only at this point)
 *   TASK_PROMPT       path to PROMPT.md
 *   BUILDER_RESULT    path to the builder's output JSON
 *   EVIDENCE          JSON of objective signals — used by the orchestrator for caps; never sent to the judge
 *   OUTPUT            path to write the merged result envelope
 *   BENCH_JUDGE_MODEL judge model ID (default us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8)
