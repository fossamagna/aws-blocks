# then wait for them to actually free up before launching `npm run dev`. The
# dev server prints an EXACT banner inside server.listen(), BEFORE Vite starts:
#   AWS Blocks local server running on http://localhost:<port>
# We anchor discovery on THAT line — no port guessing, no CANDIDATE_PORTS probe.
# A readiness gate then waits for the named port to answer HTTP <500 (5xx = not
# ready). Bounded (~60s): if the banner never appears we leave APP_BASE_URL EMPTY
# and PROCEED (green-regardless — the cell fails honestly rather than hanging,
# hard-failing, or being pointed at a guessed port).
