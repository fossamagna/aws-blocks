# ── Dev server: launch fresh + discover its port from the framework banner ───
# The verifier OWNS the server. Step 2 may have left a `tsx watch` supervisor alive, so first reap
# that tree and free the front-door ports (3000/3001 only, never :3100). Under shell isolation the
# agent's procs are benchagent-owned, so reap/free/probe go through sudo (unprivileged fallback).
# Discovery anchors on the exact banner `AWS Blocks local server running on http://localhost:<port>`,
# then a readiness gate waits (~60s) for it to answer HTTP <500; if it never does, APP_BASE_URL stays
# empty and we proceed (the cell fails honestly rather than hanging).

# Reap any dev server the agent left running. The framework records each in
# .blocks-sandbox/dev-server.<port>.pid as {pid, ppid, port}; `ppid` is the `tsx watch` supervisor
# that respawns `pid` on change. A plain `fuser -k` only kills the child, the supervisor respawns it,
# and the stale pidfile makes the framework singleton guard REFUSE our own `npm run dev`. So kill the
# supervisor tree first (ppid before pid; TERM then KILL) and delete the pidfile before freeing ports.
# Only node/tsx/npm procs are signalled (pid-reuse guard); sudo covers the cross-uid isolated case.
