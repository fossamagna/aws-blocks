// signal (e.g. the agent's bash pkill storm tearing down the harness) never runs the handler, leaving
// result.json with step-0 zeros. Writing a checkpoint every model cycle means even an abrupt kill
// leaves nonzero tokens + a partial cycle count on disk. Terminal exits overwrite it with a real
// stop_reason, so a genuine timeout stays agent_fail (included in the mean).
